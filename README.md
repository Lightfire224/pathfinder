The purpose of this project is to allow for sorting and graph algorithm visualization.

In AlgoRhythm, each bar represents a randomly generated number. All of the bars are numbers
in an array. 
The user can click on any of the sorts to see the array get sorted by whichever method they choose.
It's really cool to actually see the difference in runtime between merge sort and bubble sort!

In Algoway, each cell represents a node.
The user can place a start node and an end node. 
They can then run different algorithms to see how these algorithms traverse the grid,
until they reach the end node.

To add walls, click on the "Place Wall Node" button and then click on different nodes.
Wall nodes can be added before and while running the algorithm.

To add weights to a node, click on the "Place Weight on Node" button and then click on different nodes.
Weights must be added before running Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Enjoy!
